# Add images to a colourbox collection by script
A script to add picture IDs automatically to a specific collection on colourbox.com
This script only works when you are logged in as a user.
It is a solution to add a list of colourbox images to a collection without having to search and click every single image by hand. Colourbox don't offer a solution.

You need to find your sessionID and CartID information and replace the information in the script.
You get the collectionID after creating a new collection.

A parameter is needed in order to work. A comma-seperated CSV-File. First column picture ID

Run the script on windows commandline: addtocolourbox colourbox.csv
